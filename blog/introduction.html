<p>Hi, I&#39;m Ghassan Shahzad. I live in Lahore, Pakistan. I&#39;m a learning developer, basically a student. To be honest, I don&#39;t really know what to write here, so I&#39;ll just make it up as I go.</p>
<p>I started this website, and the blog, to just keep track of my thoughts, like a journal, and sort of as a CV. The site itself is basic HTML and CSS. I&#39;m new to web development, which is the reason for the minimalism. I kinda like the design, generally, though. </p>
<p>Generally, I plan to include my projects on the <a href="https://fr06t.github.io/projects/">projects page</a>. I&#39;ll be posting details <em>related</em> to the projects, and other stuff, on the <a href="https://fr06t.github.io/blog/">blog page</a>. </p>
<p>I also have a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/11578707/fr06t">StackOverflow</a>, though I&#39;m not experienced or learned enough to be answering any questions. My <a href="https://github.com/Fr06t/">Github</a> is a bit more active. My <a href="mailto:mysticflareplayz@gmail.com">email</a> exists too, though I haven&#39;t developed the habit of checking it. </p>
