        <h2 id="some-history">Some History</h2>
        <p>The main reason I got into programming, as a child, was actually game development. I&#39;d always been intrigued by stories; whether in books, movies, or theatre. I also enjoyed the action and control video games granted, a lot. When asked where I saw myself ten years in the future, I naturally thought <strong>&#39;Video Game Developer&#39;</strong>.</p>
        <p>The path to becoming one was complex, though. When I tried figuring out a simple roadmap to becoming a game developer, I was bombarded with <strong>a lot</strong> of contradictory advice. From &#39;You need to know programming!&#39; to &#39;None necessary&#39;. &#39;Just use a game engine!&#39; to &#39;Create your own&#39;.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, I decided to create my own engine, since that would serve as a good test: if I <em>could</em> create a game engine, alone, then I could probably design decent games. If I couldn&#39;t, I didn&#39;t deserve to. Besides, I figured creating a game engine would teach you a lot of the skills required in game development too.</p>
        <p>But the contradictions didn&#39;t end there. If you wanted to create an engine, you had to choose between C++ and C# too. Problem was: either language was far too advanced for my liking. <strong>Nobody</strong> recommended I learn C++ or C# as a first language, though, so I was stuck at step one. I had to learn programming, probably in its full, before becoming a true game developer. The <em>reality</em> stuck in. Becoming a game developer wasn&#39;t going to be easy. But, with childish naivety, I stashed my doubts away and started learning... C.</p>
        <p>I was young back then, maybe 10, so I find it easy to forgive myself, but I wasted an year laboring away at C, <em>of all languages</em>, and developed an annoyance at programming. So, I gave up. I&#39;d figured that C was a good start to learning C**++** since &#39;C++ was just a new version of C&#39;.</p>
        <p>A few <strong>years</strong> later, I <em>finally</em> discovered that Python or Lisp would&#39;ve been better starting languages, and I began work on them. Unfortunately, with school and whatever else, I didn&#39;t really get far before forgetting about the whole thing.</p>
        <p>Now, I&#39;m finally done learning Python in-depth, and I&#39;m ready to take a crack at C++, and game development as a whole. I&#39;m going to stick true to my original plan of developing my own game engine, because it seems like a sound idea, but it&#39;s just a guide for becoming a game developer. I also prefer reading, and most of my plan will be books, but I&#39;ll try and include courses.</p>
        <p>Much of this &#39;plan&#39; is probably redundant. I just went over what would cover the basics and advanced of game development and all the other dependents. I haven&#39;t (obviously) gone through it yet. Once I do, I&#39;ll probably fix it up and write up on it with more detail.</p>
        <p><strong>Bold</strong> mean mandatory.</p>
        <h2 id="the-plan">The Plan</h2>
        <p>The first step of the plan is to <strong>learn programming in-depth</strong>. Game development is just a branch-off of general development. You can follow <a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science">OSSU</a> or <a href="https://fr06t.github.io/blog/LearnDevelopment.html">my own plan</a>. Learning development in-depth is <strong>not</strong> a requirement, but it provides a good backup, I imagine.</p>
        <h3 id="learning-c">Learning C++</h3>
        <p>With that out of the way comes the mammoth task of learning C++. I divided this into three parts: Beginning, Practice, and STL (Standard Library). Asides from &#39;beginning&#39;, I plan to study the rest simultaneously with the next topics.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Beginning: <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/768080.C_Primer?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=TudLlhEyuV&amp;rank=1">C++ Primer</a></strong></li>

        </ul>
        <h3 id="the-maths--physics">The Maths &amp; Physics</h3>
        <p>I was planning on skipping this part, and the other topics on 3D stuff generally, since I was never planning on making a 3D game engine, but it might be useful in 2D game dev as well. The mathematics of <strong>programming</strong> is a separate topic, and for that you can refer to <a href="https://fr06t.github.io/blog/LearnDevelopment.html">my guide</a>.</p>
